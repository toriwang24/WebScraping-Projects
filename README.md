# WebScraping-Projects

This is a repository of my personal projects using data sourced through webscraping. In my first project, I webscraped job description data from LinkedIn. This may or may not have been for my own personal benefit as I try to gauge the job market for data science...

Anyways, in this first project I used Beautiful Soup to scrape the data, and then NLTK libraries to process the job description column to gain insights into what requirements companies are looking for in candidates. I did this by extracting common 2 word phrases. Here were some insights from my first look:


### Analyzing Job Description common phrases
* Companies are emphasizing skills in emerging technologies. This is esepcially applicable to cloud based technologies and skills involving maximizing efficiency in the cloud
    * Skills including Machine Learning, ML models, gen AI use, digital experiences, AI applications, efficient and scalable, and extrapolating data insights are all in high demand.  
* There is also a heavy focus on entrepreneurial drive and technology driven innovation.  
    * Buzz phrases including shaping the world, shaping the future, billions of people, and mission to inspire are sprinkled in lol.  
* Companies are looking for candidates with well rounded experiences, including technical skills in data science and product management, as well as soft skills around working with diverse teams.  
    * Phrases such as products build, cross-functional teams, customer service, product development, product engineering, and learning products.  
* Finally, in the age of AI and automating, I was surprised and delighted to see that many listings look for creativity and imagination.  
    * Companies surprisingly seek out applicants who relate to the following phrases: bring creativity, bring joy, inclusive and diverse, emerging artists.

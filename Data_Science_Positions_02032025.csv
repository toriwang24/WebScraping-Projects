**The Problem**

Engineering leaders are flying blind. They can’t dive in everywhere, so they need to rely on gut feel or shoddy metrics to try to get a handle on what’s going on and what needs fixing.

  


Engineering is unique in that there are no good metrics to solve this problem. And that's why we built Weave.

  


**The Solution**

Weave uses AI to understand engineering work. We run LLMs + our own models on every PR and review, analyzing both output and quality. Then, we summarize this data and insights in dashboards

  


We've built a custom machine learning model that is trained on an expert-labeled data set of PRs. The data set lets us answer the question: “how long would this PR take for an expert engineer?” This enables us to calculate the metric most companies care the most about: how much actual work is getting done:

  


**The Opportunity**

As a member of our founding team, you’ll work on our core product offering. That means you’ll have a hand in everything that our customers need.

  


The ideal candidate will be responsible for developing high-quality applications. They will also be responsible for designing and implementing testable and scalable code.

At Structured, we’re redefining how developers build and deploy data apps by consolidating the entire analytics stack into code. While AI tools like Copilot have made writing code faster, deploying production-grade data-intensive apps is still fragmented and inefficient. Trends like local-first development and in-process data querying are changing how modern apps are built: faster iteration, lower latency, and simpler infrastructure. Structured builds on these shifts with a lightweight SDK that lets developers prototype, deploy, and manage data applications (dashboards, internal tools) in hours instead of weeks. If you’re excited to build tools that push the boundaries of modern data development, join us.

* Scrappy: You move fast, prioritize ruthlessly, and aren’t afraid to get your hands dirty.
* Product-Minded: You care deeply about the developer experience and know that good products aren’t just about the code.. they’re about the people using them.

▪️What You’ll Build
  

  

You’ll have the opportunity to shape the core architecture of Structured as part of the founding team. You’ll also work closely with early users to understand their pain points, iterate fast, and make sure Structured is the best tool they’ve ever used.
  

  

* Stack: Python, Typescript, Next.js, React, Postgres, AWS/GCP
* Build the Core SDK: Create the tools that let devs handle ingestion, transformation, and visualization in one place. Make it easy for devs to deploy apps locally or in the cloud.
* Design Interactive Components: Build a library of prebuilt UI tools (think sliders, tables, and charts) that feel effortless and beautiful to use.
* Solve Hard Problems: From real-time data sync to efficient cloud deployments and scaling apps for production environments.

▪️Why Us
  

  

* Team of Experts: Join a small team of highly-skilled ex-Meta engineers who care deeply about building tools that developers love.
* Well-Funded: We’re backed by YC, General Catalyst and top-tier investors who believe in our vision and are here to help us succeed
* Ownership: As an early team member, you’ll have significant equity and the chance to shape the company from day one.",Software Development,https://www.linkedin.com/company/structuredlabs,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4E0BAQFpFuv2wIyC_Q/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1677729579665/structuredlabs_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=WUxCctWLdzdYhkr5kZN8dT1mN-WuwkZ8KejkTPtiahU,,,,,

Data protection needs for large enterprises are evolving into a varied usage of private/public clouds. While Rubrik has built incredibly successful solutions for both, our technical architecture needs to constantly evolve to fit our customers needs, working seamlessly across public/private clouds. To provide the same magical experience to our customers while maintaining the agility of a startup, we need to converge our solutions to a foundation that can be extended & re-used. This requires continuous rethink across many areas of product and stack.
  

  

At the heart of Rubrik’s architecture is an open-source scalable, distributed SQL database. This Is a fundamental building block for all infrastructure components (e.g. distributed file system) and applications (e.g. Oracle db backup) in Rubrik’s stack. Because of its central role, the performance, scalability, and availability demands from this component are continually increasing.
  

  

In addition, we are rethinking the APIs & interactions of this layer in order to continue building our infra for new and varied use cases for the public & private cloud. Being at the bottom of the stack, this layer (and the team) needs to provide guidance for all software layers above it (e.g., file system, reporting, UI) to transition smoothly.

**How We’re Different**
Etched believes in the Bitter Lesson. We think most of the progress in the AI field has come from using more FLOPs to train and run models, and the best way to get more FLOPs is to build model-specific hardware. Larger and larger training runs encourage companies to consolidate around fewer model architectures, which creates a market for single-model ASICs.

The location: Stuttgart, West Germany. Engineers are pacing with strained expressions on their faces. They are looking over the Porsche 917, the company's latest attempt at a race car. It's not working properly. The car is one of the most powerful ever built. But drivers describe it as terrifyingly unstable… ""a monster"". Despite this, Porsche runs it in Le Mans to disastrous results. One of the cars crashes on lap one, killing its driver, John Woolfe. All other 917s break down in the race.
  

  

Enter John Wyer, a British race engineer, whom the factory calls upon for help. After a long day of testing, John recognizes a lack of smashed bugs on the rear wing and deduces that the wing is not working properly. The team modifies the design to be more upward swept and the 917K takes on a new winning character. It wins LeMans outright in 1970 and goes on to be the most successful race car design of the 70s. Stability, it turns out, was the missing ingredient.
  

  

Mercury is a company that prides itself in providing powerful banking\* services. But without those services being reliable and stable, it will fail. The Stability team exists to help product engineers see those patterns of instability and remedy them. We champion and improve observability. We've helped define incident response. We have introduced and support robust background work processing. We monitor and build tooling around platform and database health. And with your help, we will explore how to make Mercury even more reliable.
  

  

As part of this role, you will:
  

  

* Write, test, debug, and ship quality code as part of our team initiatives
* Communicate with clarity about your work
* Own your tasks and keep them moving forward
* Work with project leads to understand implementation goals and give feedback on requirements
* Speak with product engineers to understand their use cases

* Has 2 or more years of backend development experience on web-based systems
* Is persistent in the face of challenges
* Can balance tradeoffs and find creative solutions to accomplish goals
* Understands the workflows of fellow engineers and is empathetic toward their needs
* Is interested in interactions between systems
* Demonstrates an interest in growing their skillset as an engineer

* Have experience working with Haskell or similar functional programming languages
* Have used PostgreSQL or another relational database

**The Problem**

Engineering leaders are flying blind. They can’t dive in everywhere, so they need to rely on gut feel or shoddy metrics to try to get a handle on what’s going on and what needs fixing.

  


Engineering is unique in that there are no good metrics to solve this problem. And that's why we built Weave.

  


**The Solution**

Weave uses AI to understand engineering work. We run LLMs + our own models on every PR and review, analyzing both output and quality. Then, we summarize this data and insights in dashboards

  


We've built a custom machine learning model that is trained on an expert-labeled data set of PRs. The data set lets us answer the question: “how long would this PR take for an expert engineer?” This enables us to calculate the metric most companies care the most about: how much actual work is getting done:

At Lilac Labs, we’re build the next big voice AI company. Our mission is to create delightful experience for our customers and our customer’s customer. Great products start with focus and craft, and we’re starting with the restaurant vertical. We've recently raised $4.2M from YC, Khosla Ventures, and Zhu Ventures, and we’re hiring for a founding engineer to join us at the ground floor. If you’re a builder at heart — this is for you.\ \
**About the role**
As a Founding Engineer, you have an outsized impact. Together with the founding team, you’ll build the foundations of our product. You’ll be part of the decision making process every step of the way. We care about your product opinions.
  

  

**You’ll Be Working With**

* Tony Kam (Co-founder / CEO): EECS @ UC Berkeley. Previously: UI + System at Tesla, Automation at Intel, Data at CloudMinds. To get our first customer, Tony camped our at the restaurant and r and literally flipped burgers.
* Shelden Shi (Co-founder / CTO): CS + CogSci @ UC Berkeley. Previously: Founding engineer @ Fintech with $1B AUM. Shelden was also a semi-pro poker player.

**You’ll Will Be Working On**
Tech Stack: NodeJS, NextJS, TypeScript, Python, C++, MongoDB (or you can change our mind here)
  

  

Core Technologies: ASR, VAD, LLMs, Speech Synthesis (TTS), S3, EC2,
  

  

Understand enough to be dangerous : Distributed Systems, Networking, Embedded Systems, Streaming Algorithms, Audio Processing, Deep Learning, Fine-tuning and Model Distillation.
  

  

Core Priorities of this year: Product must work and pass the threshold of “is it useful in the field” — and beyond that… “is it delightful for the end customer.”
  

  

Types of problems you may work on include: designing and implementing the scalable backend for our product, such that the AI order taker can reliably handle concurrent requests in real-time.
  

  

**What It’s Like Working Here**
We value an idea meritocracy: in practice, this is open, transparent feedback. We want to work with people who push and challenge each other to be better. For this to happen, we need a high trust culture where we can disagree and commit. We think like owners. We care a lot and pride ourselves with quality and craft of our work. We work in person at least 5 days a week at our HQ in SF. Our office is in the Mission, around 20th and Harrison. We care about impact, but for a small team, face time matters too! And that’s where we think the best collaboration happens.

The location: Stuttgart, West Germany. Engineers are pacing with strained expressions on their faces. They are looking over the Porsche 917, the company's latest attempt at a race car. It's not working properly. The car is one of the most powerful ever built. But drivers describe it as terrifyingly unstable… ""a monster"". Despite this, Porsche runs it in Le Mans to disastrous results. One of the cars crashes on lap one, killing its driver, John Woolfe. All other 917s break down in the race.
  

  

Enter John Wyer, a British race engineer, whom the factory calls upon for help. After a long day of testing, John recognizes a lack of smashed bugs on the rear wing and deduces that the wing is not working properly. The team modifies the design to be more upward swept and the 917K takes on a new winning character. It wins LeMans outright in 1970 and goes on to be the most successful race car design of the 70s. Stability, it turns out, was the missing ingredient.
  

  

Mercury is a company that prides itself in providing powerful banking\* services. But without those services being reliable and stable, it will fail. The Stability team exists to help product engineers see those patterns of instability and remedy them. We champion and improve observability. We've helped define incident response. We have introduced and support robust background work processing. We monitor and build tooling around platform and database health. And with your help, we will explore how to make Mercury even more reliable.

2/ Say you want a job at FAANG or Series C+ later - You’ll be working with experienced multi-time founders who have led Engineering and Product at Facebook, Robinhood, and Mapbox. We know what it takes to succeed at bigger companies and happy to share war stories.

  


3/ Let’s say you want to start a startup. You’ll learn the ins and outs of fundraising, managing investors, finding PMF, preparing for hyperscaling, hiring/firing, and selling a product while building it.

  


4/ Finally, maybe you want to build and lead a team. We’re going to grow Eng around a solid founding engineer. We’ve managed teams of 100’s with 30 directs between founders, and we’ll be helping you as a founding engineer build out a killer high-functional team.

If any or all of these 4 sounds like where you want to take your career, we would like to meet you.

  


You’re probably not a fit if:


* You just want to code and don’t want to hang out with the growing team or customers
* You have super strong opinions on tech stack and are inflexible on them
* You don’t want to work hard and have fun with your coworkers

  


What you’ll actually be doing


* Architect and build cutting-edge AI data extraction systems
* Work directly with customers to tackle their toughest data challenges often with creative solutions
* Push the boundaries of AI tech and stay on the cutting edge of LLM developments. Each foundational model change opens up new possibilities for Reprompt and our customers
* Own projects end-to-end from working with founders or customers on the product proposal, architecting, building, evaluating and testing, shipping to prod, and integrating with customers.

  


Reprompt perks


* Free gym benefit
* Free lunches and fancy espresso machine in the office
* Company events including happy hours, sauna/cold plunge wellness retreats, Barrys bootcamp, and snow trips

We need a founding, full-stack engineer who wants to work alongside us and our unicorn/decacorn customers, to build an agentic SSO platform.
  

  

**Who are we?**
Single Sign On systems (e.g., Okta) are the foundation of company security. Simply put, they connect employees to their work apps (AWS, Slack, etc.). When apps are managed by SSO, they’re protected by the company’s suite of security tools (e.g. access logs). If an app isn’t connected to SSO, it’s vulnerable.
  

  

Existing SSOs are broken, as they require connected apps to support a series of protocols (e.g., SAML). Most apps either paywall the protocols, or just don’t support them - leaving critical services (bank accounts, Apple Developer, etc.) vulnerable.
  

  

We spent the last 18 months inventing an entirely novel solution to fix this. What it does today is quite simple: it takes any app and connects it to a company’s SSO, without using the protocols. However, because it’s agentic, what we want it to do tomorrow is incredibly exciting.
  

  

Customers love Aglide. Giants (unicorns, decacorns) are discovering us deep on Reddit forums, overlooking our currently small size, and closing 6-figure deals with us. We have (a lot) more customers than capacity. So, we just closed a $3+ million seed from the world’s greatest investor, are moving our HQ to San Francisco, and are setting out to build a unicorn.
  

  

**The Job**
As a Founding Engineer, You’ll Do More Than Write Good Code And Release Features. You’ll Help Us Work Out How To Make a Local Agent Do Amazing Things For Amazing Customers. To Do This, You Will
  

  

* Join calls with exciting companies (speaking to people who may be entirely assigned to implementing our platform) to learn about their countless problems.
* Make a series of “educated bets” on how you can fix them.
* Work independently to build and ship your solutions extremely fast (that week).

When it all works, it makes the evenings and weekends worth it. While we’re comfortable with a little tech debt, we will never cut corners on security. Our entire stack is zero-trust, end-to-end encrypted, and almost every task is performed locally.
  

  

You’re joining this EARLY. It’s unstructured but you’ll get to see and define the future of an inflecting startup.
  

  

**Required Skills**

* Comfortable with the full stack:

+ Backend: Node/Express, Postgres (Prisma)
+ Frontend: React

* Product thinking: Desire to pick up customer insights, rapidly design and ship tasteful solutions, get their feedback, and iterate.
* Founder thinking: Comfortable with the day-to-day demands of a growth startup - able to move fast, using modern tools, without getting distracted by fads.

**Highly Desirable Skills**

* Experience with any of the following:

+ Typescript
+ Electron
+ Web-scripting / automation (Puppeteer a massive plus)
+ Chrome Extensions

* Experience building highly secure systems, e.g. zero-trust and end-to-end encryption.
* Experience with cybersecurity or knowledge of SSO, identity, etc.
* Worked in startups, and willing to help us shape team processes and culture.
* Opinionated on SaaS, design, startups, and technology.

**Benefits**

* Competitive salary and equity options. You should describe Aglide as “my company”.
* Potential US Visa Sponsorship. Most appropriate for candidates who can start in our London office, and move with the founders to establish our new SF HQ.
* Private medical, and any equipment/tools you need to work your best.
* Weekly lunches, and dinner if we’re working late.
* Periodic remote work when it’s viable project-wise (we’re in the office most days).
* Access to Aglide’s line of apparel (we don’t do merch).",Data Security Software Products,https://uk.linkedin.com/company/aglide,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEt5nkB69evrQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1688425259899/aglide_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=aCdRN-IpU8pwjCsfaetEKONwAd_x69TsQBKmXq8nzzE,,,,,

Etched is building AI chips that are hard-coded for individual model architectures. Our first product (Sohu) only supports transformers, but has an order of magnitude more throughput and lower latency than a B200. With Etched ASICs, you can build products that would be impossible with GPUs, like real-time video generation models and extremely deep & parallel chain-of-thought reasoning agents.
  

  

**Key Responsibilities**

* Oversee SoC bring-up on emulation platforms; diagnose and resolve failing SoC/Processor tests.
* Develop innovative techniques to accelerate pre-silicon validation and software development.
* Provide support for various emulation environments, utilizing advanced emulation techniques including C/C++ DPI transactors, coverage analysis, and in-circuit emulation for high-speed protocols.
* Collaborate closely with teams across Design, DV, Silicon Validation, Performance, and Software, and partner with leading emulation vendors to enhance platform capabilities and troubleshoot complex issues.

**Representative projects**

* Develop high-performance software to capture debugging signals and create associated tooling to surface valuable insights for users.
* Implement a hybrid emulation environment using custom DPI-based streaming transactors.
* Create highly configurable chip-to-chip network models using emulation-efficient primitives.

**You may be a good fit if you have**

**How We’re Different**
Etched believes in the Bitter Lesson. We think most of the progress in the AI field has come from using more FLOPs to train and run models, and the best way to get more FLOPs is to build model-specific hardware. Larger and larger training runs encourage companies to consolidate around fewer model architectures, which creates a market for single-model ASICs.

We need a founding, full-stack engineer who wants to work alongside us and our unicorn/decacorn customers, to build an agentic SSO platform.
  

  

**Who are we?**
Single Sign On systems (e.g., Okta) are the foundation of company security. Simply put, they connect employees to their work apps (AWS, Slack, etc.). When apps are managed by SSO, they’re protected by the company’s suite of security tools (e.g. access logs). If an app isn’t connected to SSO, it’s vulnerable.
  

  

Existing SSOs are broken, as they require connected apps to support a series of protocols (e.g., SAML). Most apps either paywall the protocols, or just don’t support them - leaving critical services (bank accounts, Apple Developer, etc.) vulnerable.
  

  

We spent the last 18 months inventing an entirely novel solution to fix this. What it does today is quite simple: it takes any app and connects it to a company’s SSO, without using the protocols. However, because it’s agentic, what we want it to do tomorrow is incredibly exciting.
  

  

Customers love Aglide. Giants (unicorns, decacorns) are discovering us deep on Reddit forums, overlooking our currently small size, and closing 6-figure deals with us. We have (a lot) more customers than capacity. So, we just closed a $3+ million seed from the world’s greatest investor, are moving our HQ to San Francisco, and are setting out to build a unicorn.
  

  

**The Job**
As a Founding Engineer, You’ll Do More Than Write Good Code And Release Features. You’ll Help Us Work Out How To Make a Local Agent Do Amazing Things For Amazing Customers. To Do This, You Will
  

  

* Join calls with exciting companies (speaking to people who may be entirely assigned to implementing our platform) to learn about their countless problems.
* Make a series of “educated bets” on how you can fix them.
* Work independently to build and ship your solutions extremely fast (that week).

When it all works, it makes the evenings and weekends worth it. While we’re comfortable with a little tech debt, we will never cut corners on security. Our entire stack is zero-trust, end-to-end encrypted, and almost every task is performed locally.
  

  

You’re joining this EARLY. It’s unstructured but you’ll get to see and define the future of an inflecting startup.
  

  

**Required Skills**

* Comfortable with the full stack:

+ Backend: Node/Express, Postgres (Prisma)
+ Frontend: React

* Product thinking: Desire to pick up customer insights, rapidly design and ship tasteful solutions, get their feedback, and iterate.
* Founder thinking: Comfortable with the day-to-day demands of a growth startup - able to move fast, using modern tools, without getting distracted by fads.

**Highly Desirable Skills**

* Experience with any of the following:

+ Typescript
+ Electron
+ Web-scripting / automation (Puppeteer a massive plus)
+ Chrome Extensions

* Experience building highly secure systems, e.g. zero-trust and end-to-end encryption.
* Experience with cybersecurity or knowledge of SSO, identity, etc.
* Worked in startups, and willing to help us shape team processes and culture.
* Opinionated on SaaS, design, startups, and technology.

**Benefits**

* Competitive salary and equity options. You should describe Aglide as “my company”.
* Potential US Visa Sponsorship. Most appropriate for candidates who can start in our London office, and move with the founders to establish our new SF HQ.
* Private medical, and any equipment/tools you need to work your best.
* Weekly lunches, and dinner if we’re working late.
* Periodic remote work when it’s viable project-wise (we’re in the office most days).
* Access to Aglide’s line of apparel (we don’t do merch).",Data Security Software Products,https://uk.linkedin.com/company/aglide,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E0BAQEt5nkB69evrQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1688425259899/aglide_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=aCdRN-IpU8pwjCsfaetEKONwAd_x69TsQBKmXq8nzzE,,,,,

Etched believes in the Bitter Lesson. We think most of the progress in the AI field has come from using more FLOPs to train and run models, and the best way to get more FLOPs is to build model-specific hardware. Larger and larger training runs encourage companies to consolidate around fewer model architectures, which creates a market for single-model ASICs.

Every B2B company grapples with this challenge. If you've ever seen sales and marketing teams struggling to find effective strategies, you understand the problem we're solving. Join us in our mission to make good companies
**great**
.
  

  

We graduated from YC’s Summer 23 batch and we've roughly doubled our ARR every 6 months since then. If you join, you'll be part of a high-growth startup with proven product-market fit, methodically building a billion-dollar company through a high-performance culture and exceptional talent.
  

  

**What We Value**

* Builders.

+ Coding well is a rigorous craft. We are looking for people who enjoy coding just for the sake of it. That’s how you build really cool stuff.

* Ownership.

+ Expect to own a crucial part of the product within your first two weeks. No jokes. We’ve seen that only the ones who can take this kind of a responsibility can thrive in this environment.

* Shipping. Fast.

+ You don’t need to break things to move fast. But you do need a certain kind of mentality to know what shortcuts you can take and what tradeoffs you can make. How else can you grow fast if you aren’t deploying to prod every day?

* Scalability.

+ Writing production-ready code is a very different thing when you have 1 customer versus over 100. You should take pride in thinking through every line of code you write and any edge cases it might introduce.

****Fun Facts****

* Some of our SQL queries involve more than 500 lines of code.
* We are munging and managing more than 60TB of data for our customers
* We process high-throughput data from 30+ data sources

**About The Role**
****Who we’re looking for****
You might call yourself a SQL expert, a database engineer, or just a strong backend engineer. You love going deep into optimizing slow things, thinking about different ways to store data and, most importantly, uncovering insights from TBs of data.
  

  

****Your Mission: Transforming Data into Gold****
You’ll primarily work in our Node.js backend and maintain how the app gets data from the database. This includes writing and optimizing SQL queries but also includes dealing with deep business logic about transforming this data in Javascript before sending it to the frontend.
  

  

This requires understanding both how data flows into our systems but also how and why people interact with the product itself.
  

  

**Requirements**

* San Francisco, in person every day
* Good backend knowledge (Node.js, Express)
* Exposure to SQL beforehand
* Move fast and reach milestones under uncertainty
* Ready to work really hard on really hard problems

****Bonus Points****

* High-growth SaaS experience, including scalability challenges
* Familiarity with ClickHouse (our main analytical database)

**Benefits**
Some of the cool benefits we offer aside from the cool technical work you get to do alongside some smart engineers:
  

  

* TOP salary + meaningful equity
* Beautiful office near South Park in SF
* Catered daily meals (coming soon)
* Unlimited Beer & diet coke (because who likes coke zero :d)
* 401K & Health,Dental and Vision insurance
